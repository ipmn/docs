# Data Privacy

The Internet Protocol Measurement Network (IPMN) offers users the flexibility to choose between public and private probes and checks, enabling them to control privacy while benefiting from community collaboration.

### Public Probes

Public probes are shared within the IPMN community, allowing users to schedule measurements and access the results. This encourages collaboration and shared learning among users.

### Private Probes

Private probes are exclusive to their owners, who can schedule measurements and view the results. This offers control and confidentiality for users with specific requirements or privacy concerns.

### Checks

IPMN allows users to schedule public and private checks, providing a balance between data visibility and privacy:

- **Public Checks**: Accessible by all users, these checks promote knowledge sharing and collective learning, helping users identify trends and potential issues.

- **Private Checks**: With restricted access, private check results are visible only to the check creator and the owner of the public probe used for the check, ensuring data privacy while providing valuable insights for probe owners.
