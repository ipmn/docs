# Probe Deployment: Docker

This guide will walk you through deploying an IPMN probe using Docker.

### Prerequisites

- A registered probe on the IPMN App with a unique Probe ID (UUID) and authentication token (SECRET).
- A system with Docker installed.

### Deployment Steps

1. **Pull the IPMN probe Docker image**: Pull the official IPMN probe image from the GitHub Container Registry using the following command:
   ```bash copy
   docker pull ghcr.io/ipmn/probe:latest
   ```
1. **Create and run a new Docker container**: Run a new Docker container with the IPMN probe image. Replace `Probe_UUID` and `Authentication_Token` with the Probe ID and authentication token you received when registering your probe.
   ```bash copy
   docker run -d --restart always --name ipmn-probe -e UUID=<Probe_UUID> -e SECRET=<Authentication_Token> ghcr.io/ipmn/probe:latest
   ```
1. **Verify the probe is running**: Check the status of the IPMN probe container:

   ```bash copy
   docker ps -f name=ipmn-probe
   ```

   If everything is set up correctly, you should see the container running and active.

1. **Check container logs**: To view the logs of the IPMN probe container, use the following command:
   ```bash copy
   docker logs ipmn-probe
   ```
   This will display the container's logs, which can be helpful for troubleshooting or monitoring the probe's activity.

Your IPMN probe is now deployed and running as a Docker container. The probe will execute assigned tasks and submit the results to the IPMN App, contributing valuable data to the platform.
