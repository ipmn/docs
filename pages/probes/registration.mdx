# Probe Registration

Before deploying an IPMN probe, you must register it on the IPMN platform. This guide will walk you through the process of registering a new probe.

## Registering a New Probe

1. **Log in to your IPMN account**: Go to [IPMN App](https://app.ipmn.io) and log in using your credentials. If you don't have an account yet, sign up for one.

1. **Go to the "Probes"**: Once logged in, find and click on the "Probes" menu item in the main navigation bar or go directly to the [Probes](https://app.ipmn.io/probes) page.

1. **Add a new probe**: Click the "Create Probe" button to open the registration form and provide details about your new probe, such as the probe name and location.

1. **Submit the form**: Click the "Submit" button to complete the registration process. The IPMN platform will generate a unique `Probe ID` and `secret` for your new probe.

1. **Probe ID and secret**: Copy `Probe ID` and `secret` you receive, as you'll need them during the deployment process.

You have now successfully registered a new probe on the IPMN platform. Proceed to the next section in the documentation to learn how to deploy your probe using either precompiled Golang binaries and systemd, or Docker.
