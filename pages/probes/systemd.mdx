# Probe Deployment: systemd

This guide will walk you through deploying an IPMN probe using the precompiled binary and systemd.

### Prerequisites

- A registered probe in the [IPMN App](https://app.ipmn.io) with a unique Probe ID (UUID) and authentication token (SECRET).
- A Linux system with systemd installed.

### Deployment Steps

1.  **Download the precompiled binary**: Visit the probe [releases](https://github.com/ipmn/probe/releases) page and download the appropriate precompiled binary for your system.

1.  **Make the binary executable**: Move the binary to a suitable location, such as /usr/local/bin/, and make it executable with the following command:

    ```bash copy
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ipmn-probe
    ```

1.  **Create a systemd service file**: Create a new systemd service file at /etc/systemd/system/ipmn-probe.service with the following content:

    ```ini copy
    [Unit]
    Description=IPMN Probe
    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Environment="UUID=<Probe_UUID>"
    Environment="SECRET=<Authentication_Token>"
    ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ipmn-probe
    Restart=always
    User=root

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    Replace `Probe_UUID` and `Authentication_Token` with the Probe ID and authentication token you received when registering your probe.

1.  **Reload systemd**: Inform systemd of the new service file and enable it to start automatically at boot:

        ```bash copy
        sudo systemctl daemon-reload
        sudo systemctl enable ipmn-probe.service
        ```

1.  **Start the IPMN probe**: Start the IPMN probe service with the following command:

    ```bash copy
    sudo systemctl start ipmn-probe.service
    ```

1.  **Verify the probe is running**: Check the status of the IPMN probe service:
    ```bash copy
    sudo systemctl status ipmn-probe.service
    ```
    If everything is set up correctly, you should see the service running and active.

### Updating the IPMN Probe

To update the IPMN probe to the latest version, follow these steps:

1. **Stop the IPMN probe service**: Stop the running IPMN probe service with the following command:

   ```bash copy
   sudo systemctl stop ipmn-probe.service
   ```

1. **Download the latest IPMN probe binary**: Download the latest precompiled IPMN probe binary from the [releases](https://github.com/ipmn/probe/releases) page.

1. **Replace the existing binary**: Replace the existing IPMN probe binary with the new one you just downloaded. Ensure that the file permissions are set to make it executable:

   ```bash copy
   mv /path/to/new-ipmn-probe /usr/local/bin/ipmn-probe
   chmod +x /usr/local/bin/ipmn-probe
   ```

1. **Start the updated IPMN probe**: Start the updated IPMN probe service with the following command:

   ```bash copy
   sudo systemctl start ipmn-probe.service
   ```

1. **Verify the updated probe is running**: Check the status of the updated IPMN probe service:
   ```bash copy
   sudo systemctl status ipmn-probe.service
   ```
   You should see the service running and active with the updated binary.

Your IPMN probe is now deployed and running as a systemd service. The probe will execute assigned tasks and submit the results to the IPMN, contributing valuable data to the platform.
